0,                    Objects Used to Prop Open a Window                ,Dog bone, stapler,cribbage board, garlic press     because this window is loose—lackssuction, lacks grip.Bungee cord, bootstrap,dog leash, leather belt     because this window had sash cords.They frayed. They broke.Feather duster, thatch of straw, emptybottle of Elmer's glue     because this window is loud—its hinges clackopen, clack shut.Stuffed bear, baby blanket,single crib newel     because this window is split. It's dividingin two.Velvet moss, sagebrush,willow branch, robin's wing     because this window, it's pane-less. It's onlya frame of air.,Michelle Menting,
1,                    The New Church                ,The old cupola glinted above the clouds, shoneamong fir trees, but it took him an hourfor the half mile all the way up the hill. As he trailed,the village passed him by, greeted him,asked about his health, but everybody hurriedto catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,measuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.He yearned for the day when the new churchwould be built—right across the road. Nowit rises above the moon: saints in frescoesmeet the eye, and only the rain has started to cutthrough the shingles on the roof of his emptyhouse. The apple trees have taken over the sky,sequestered the gate, sidled over the porch.,Lucia Cherciu,
2,                    Look for Me                ,Look for me under the hoodof that old Chevrolet settled in weedsat the end of the pasture.I'm the radiator that spent its yearsbolted in front of an engineshoving me forward into the wind.Whatever was in me in those dayshas mostly leaked away,but my cap's still screwed on tightand I know the names of all thesetattered moths and broken grasshoppersthe rest of you've forgotten.,Ted Kooser,
3,                    Wild Life                ,Behind the silo, the Mother Rabbithunches like a giant spider with strange calm:six tiny babies beneath, eachclamoring for a sweet syringe of milk.This may sound cute to you, readingfrom your pulpit of plenty,but one small one was left out of reach,a knife of furbarging between the others.I watched behind a turret of sand. IfI could have cautioned the mother rabbitI would. If I could summon theBunnies to fit him in beneaththe belly's swellI would. But instead, I stood frozen, wishingfor some equity. This must bewhy it's called Wild Life because of all thecrazed emotions tangled up inthe underbrush within us.Did I tell you howthe smallest one, black and trembling,hopped behind the kudzustill filigreed with wanting?Should we talk now of animal heritage, their species,creature development? And what do we sayabout form and focus—writing this when a stray goes hungry, and away.,Grace Cavalieri,
4,                    Umbrella                ,When I push your buttonyou fly off the handle,old skin and bones,black bat wing.We're alike, you and I.Both of usresemble my mother,so fierce in her advocacyon behalf ofthe most vulnerable childwho'll catch his deathin this tempest.Such a headwind!Sometimes it requiresall my strengthjust to end a line.But when the wind is atmy back, we're likelyto get carried away, and saysomething we can never retract,something saturated from the ribsdown, an old stonyword like ruin. You're what roofI have, frail thing,you're my argumentagainst the whole sky.You're the fundamental differencebetween wet and dry.,Connie Wanek,
5,                    Sunday                ,You are the start of the weekor the end of it, and accordingto The Beatles you creep inlike a nun. You're the secondfull day the kids have beenaway with their father, the secondfull day of an empty house.Sunday, I've missed you. I've beensitting in the backyard with a glassof Pinot waiting for your arrival.Did you know the first Sweet 100sare turning red in the garden,but the lettuce has growntoo bitter to eat. I am lookingup at the bluest sky I have ever seen,cerulean blue, a heaven skyno one would believe I was under.You are my witness. No dayis promised. You are absolution.You are my unwritten to-do list,my dishes in the sink, my browniebreakfast, my braless day.,January Gill O'Neil,
6,                    Invisible Fish                ,Invisible fish swim this ghost ocean now described by waves of sand, by water-worn rock. Soon the fish will learn to walk. Then humans will come ashore and paint dreams on the dying stone. Then later, much later, the ocean floor will be punctuated by Chevy trucks, carrying the dreamers’ decendants, who are going to the store.,Joy Harjo,Living,Time & Brevity,Relationships,Family & Ancestors,Nature,Landscapes & Pastorals,Seas, Rivers, & Streams,Social Commentaries,History & Politics
7,                    Don’t Bother the Earth Spirit                ,Don’t bother the earth spirit who lives here. She is working on a story. It is the oldest story in the world and it is delicate, changing. If she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee, give you warm bread, and you will be obligated to stay and listen. But this is no ordinary story. You will have to endure earthquakes, lightning, the deaths of all those you love, the most blinding beauty. It’s a story so compelling you may never want to leave; this is how she traps you. See that stone finger over there? That is the only one who ever escaped.,Joy Harjo,Religion,The Spiritual,Mythology & Folklore,Fairy-tales & Legends
8,                    The One Thing That Can Save America                ,Is anything central?Orchards flung out on the land,Urban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?Are place names central?Elm Grove, Adcock Corner, Story Book Farm?As they concur with a rush at eye levelBeating themselves into eyes which have had enoughThank you, no more thank you.And they come on like scenery mingled with darknessThe damp plains, overgrown suburbs,Places of known civic pride, of civil obscurity. These are connected to my version of AmericaBut the juice is elsewhere.This morning as I walked out of your roomAfter breakfast crosshatched withBackward and forward glances, backward into light,Forward into unfamiliar light,Was it our doing, and was itThe material, the lumber of life, or of livesWe were measuring, counting?A mood soon to be forgottenIn crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadowIn this morning that has seized us again? I know that I braid too much on my ownSnapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.They are private and always will be.Where then are the private turns of eventDestined to bloom later like golden chimesReleased over a city from a highest tower?The quirky things that happen to me, and I tell you,And you know instantly what I mean?What remote orchard reached by winding roadsHides them? Where are these roots? It is the lumps and trialsThat tell us whether we shall be knownAnd whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.All the rest is waitingFor a letter that never arrives,Day after day, the exasperationUntil finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,The two envelope halves lying on a plate.The message was wise, and seeminglyDictated a long time ago, but its time has stillNot arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limitedSteps that can be taken against dangerNow and in the future, in cool yards,In quiet small houses in the country,Our country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.,John Ashbery,
9,                    ["Hour in which I consider hydrangea"]                ,Hour in which I consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother I know, 5 pounds feels like 20, I have lost … I have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, I externalize beauty. Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.,Simone White,Living,Parenthood,The Body,The Mind,Nature,Trees & Flowers
10,                    Stung                ,She couldn't help but sting my finger,clinging a moment before I flung herto the ground. Her gold is true, not the trickevening light plays on my roses.She curls into herself, stinger twitching,gilt wings folded. Her whole life just a few weeks,and my pain subsided in a moment.In the cold, she hardly had her wits to buzz.No warning from either of us:she sleeping in the richness of those petals,then the hand, my hand, cupping the bloomin devastating force, crushing the petals for the scent.And she mortally threatened, wholly unawarethat I do this daily, alone with the gold last light,in what seems to me an act of love.,Heid E. Erdrich,
11,                    Nothing But Good...                ,I will not speak ill of Jack Flick.I will rarely lookat the scar he made on my cheekone summer at the lake.I won't speak ill of Jack whose frecklesand gangly legs are gone.So is the drained face I saw when he sawwhat he'd done with a sharp rocknonchalantly skipped.I will speak well, for it was somewhatsweet to lie on the dock while Jackand his friends bent downand wiped my face with a sandy towel.I will speak well of them,for most are goneand the wound proved small.I will speak well, for the rockmissed my eye. I can hardly findthe scar. Jack went into the aircorps, fought in one of the wars,retired, and lived less than a yearbefore his tender heart gave out.I will speak well of Jack.,Sarah White,
12,                    How Quiet                ,How quiet is the spruce,the wind twillsthrough the uppermost tierof splayed leaves.Now the song of a birdlike the squeaky lockover a canoe's oar,followed by startling chirps,the sky pushing its cloudslike sailboats,and I think, what kind of Godkeeps himself secretso that to find him outwe have to seek, as children dofor something like the beetlescuttling between grass,hidden in plain sight.,Judith Harris,
13,                    Porcupine                ,You think we are the pointed argument,the man drunk at the party showing offhis gun collection, the bed of nettles. What we really are is hidden from you:girl weeping in the closet among her stepfather's boots;tuft of rabbit fur caught in barbed wire; body of the babyin the landfill; boy with the shy mouth playing his guitarat the picnic table, out in the dirt yard. We slide into this world benign and pliable,quills pressed down smooth over back and tail.Only one hour here stiffens the barbs into thousandsof quick retorts. Everything this well-guardedremembers being soft once.,Kelly Madigan,
14,                    Summer Apples                ,I planted an apple tree in memoryof my mother, who is not gone, but whose memory has becomeso transparent that she remembers slicing apples with her grandmother(yellow apples; blue bowl) better than the fruit that I hand her today. Still,she polishes the surface with her thumb, holds it to the light and says with nohesitation, Oh, Yellow Transparent . . .  they're so fragile, you can almost seeto the core. She no longer remembers how to roll the crust, sweeten the sauce, buther desire is clear—it is pie that she wants. And so, I slice as close as I dare to the core—to that little cathedral to memory—where the seeds remember everything they needto know to become yellow and transparent.  ,Cathryn Essinger,
15,                    Visiting the Neighborhood                ,The entrance at the back of the complexled onto a road, where an upended couchtilted into a ditch and a washing machinegleamed avocado beneath pine needles. From the end, you turned left and left again,then cut a trail to find the cul-de-sacof bright brick houses. We'd walk as faras we dared before a man pushing a mower might stop to ask, "whadda you boys need?"That was a question we could never answer.I loved the name of the place, White Hall,imagined that each interior was a stretch of marble perfect wall adorned by smilingphotos of the family. Our own hallswere brailled with nail holes of formertenants, the spackled rounds of fists. But doesn't longing clarify the body?The boys I left behind: Tommy, wearingthe World War II trenching tool;Danny, whose father, so much older than the other parents, died in his reclinerone sunny afternoon while watching baseball;Duke, who stole his mother's car and crashedinto a wall. Boys who knew when you were posing, waiting for someone to say, "smile." Boyswho, on those latch-key days, held themselvesin narrow passages when no onewas there to show them what to do.  ,P.

18,                    West of Myself                ,Why are you still seventeenand drifting like a dog after dark,dragging a shadow you’ve found? Put it back where it belongs,and that bend of river, too. That’s not the roadyou want, though you have it to yourself. Gone are the cars that crawl to townfrom the reactors, a parade of insects, metallic,fuming along the one four-lane street. The poplars of the shelterbelt lean awayfrom the bypass that never had much to pass bybut coyote and rabbitbrush. Pinpricks stabbed in a map too dark to read—I stared at stars light-years away.Listen. That hissing? Just a sprinkler damping down yesterday until it’s today.The cottonwoods shiver, or I do,every leaf rustling as if it’s the one about to tear itself, not I.Memory takes the graveyard shift. ,Debora Greger,Coming of Age
19,                    Yes                ,Yes, your childhood now a legend of fountains                                                         —jorge gullénYes, your childhood, now a legendgone to weeds, still remembers the gray roadthat set out to cross the desert of the future. And how, always just ahead,gray water glittered, happy to be just a mirage.Who steps off the gray bus at the depot? Sidewalks shudder all the way home.Blinds close their scratchy eyes.Who settles in your old room? Sniffy air sprawls as if it owns the place,and now your teenage secrets have no one to tell.For the spider laying claim to the corner, there is a stickiness to spin, that the living may begto be wrapped in silk and devoured,leaving not even the flinch from memory.,Debora Greger,Coming of Age,Youth
20,                    Bounden Duty                ,               I got a call from the White House, from thePresident himself, asking me if I’d do him a personalfavor. I like the President, so I said, “Sure, Mr.President, anything you like.” He said, “Just actlike nothing’s going on. Act normal. That wouldmean the world to me. Can you do that, Leon?” “Why,sure, Mr. President, you’ve got it. Normal, that’show I’m going to act. I won’t let on, even if I’mtortured,” I said, immediately regretting that “tortured”bit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I wasdying to tell someone that the President himself calledme, but I knew I couldn’t. The sudden pressure toact normal was killing me. And what was going onanyway. I didn’t know anything was going on. Isaw the President on TV yesterday. He was shakinghands with a farmer. What if it wasn’t really afarmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenlyI was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.I looked “normal” to me, but maybe I looked morelike I was trying to be normal. That’s prettysuspicious. I opened the door and looked around.What was going on? There was a car parked in frontof my car that I had never seen before, a car thatwas trying to look normal, but I wasn’t fooled.If you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwisepeople will think something’s going on. I got intomy car and sped down the road. I could feel thoselittle radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,but, apparently, they were under orders not to stopme. I ran into Kirsten in the store. “Hey, what’sgoing on, Leon?” she said. She had a very nice smile.I hated to lie to her. “Nothing’s going on. Justgetting milk for my cat,” I said. “I didn’t knowyou had a cat,” she said. “I meant to say coffee.You’re right, I don’t have a cat. Sometimes Irefer to my coffee as my cat. It’s just a privatejoke. Sorry,” I said. “Are you all right?” sheasked. “Nothing’s going on, Kirsten. I promiseyou. Everything is normal. The President shookhands with a farmer, a real farmer. Is that sucha big deal?” I said. “I saw that,” she said, “andthat man was definitely not a farmer.” “Yeah, Iknow,” I said, feeling better. ,James Tate,Humor & Satire,History & Politics
21,                    History                ,Of course wars, of course lice, of course limbs on opposing sidesto remind a body about ambivalence, of course orphans and empty beds and eyesexiled for blinking in the harsh light. Of course Khrushchev gave Crimeato the Ukraine in a blind drunk, and yes, land mines and burning skinand of course organs, some members dismemberedto shake at strangers and their evil, and there is no wayto imagine that a man shaking a dried penis would ever utter the word darling.Of course personal, add starch for pain, add bluing, of course hangthe laundry in the basement, there are thieves in the backyard, of coursedeparting trains, carload after carload of sorrow,the man on top of a boxcar waving,his rifle silhouetted against the white sky, its color drainingthe way warmth left the Bosnian after he’d burned the last page of the last book,knowing he had reached the end of something though it was not end enough.Of course kisses, the stages of kissing like running borders,endless conversations, stations of the cross, till even the promise of kissing bores you,of course teeth gnashing, ethnic cleansing. The cynical will shrug off the past,the future, the whole left hip of Ecuador slashed for six days of oil,of course an X on the coats of the sick so they would stand apartfor deportation, of course rogue tumors over the body politic,the same bodies that took Egyptian mummies and powdered themto use as food seasoning, bon vivant cannibalism,and yes civilized men tossed living penguins into furnaces to fuel their ships.Of course partitions so that after the new territories were defined,families had to line up on a cliff with bullhornsto talk to their people on the other side,of course courage, at times a weapon against yearning, surrender another,a mother of course goes on setting the table, even if it’s with broken plates,and a friend will say gently of course I want to ride with you to the funeral,of course of course of course of course,now then, negotiations, whatever,palisades, the end of whimsy,but then one evening though it is wartime,a man climbs the hill to an amphitheater to play his cello at twilightand history stops talking for a moment and sighswhile the melancholy of Albinonipasses from heart to heart and each lifts a little,the way passing a baby around a room can be sacramental,and the memories of simple pleasures become more beautiful, the memoryof your joy on a highway to see in the next lane in a neighboring cara clown take off his nose at the end of the day, the memoryof how your mother laid roses, sweetheart roses, on the cold grate of the fireplace,and the sudden rain one afternoon in fall after you’d hiked far into the dellsand you huddled deep in your overcoat in the wet,waiting out the storm with a sheepthat had come up to lean against your sidelike a rock. ,Barbara Ras,History & Politics,War & Conflict
22,                    What It Was Like                ,If they ask what it was like, say it was like the searolling barrels of itself at you in the shadowless light of the shore,say it was like a spider, black as night, large as a campesino’s hand,a deepness that could balance a small world of dirt as easily as a giftof gleaming red tomatoes held out to you eight at a time.If they ask you how it felt, say solitary,at first the ease of sleeping alone, warm without even a sheet,then the nonchalance of a dirt road leading down the hill, its dustraised and re-raised in plumes as each guest departed,and later, say it was like the blind cat that came out of nowhereto lie on your tile floor, lifting its face to stare with white marble eyes.If they ask what you heard, tell them the single note of the watchman,who coughed his one syllable when you went to bed,and at the end of every dream when you woke with a simple plea—stay, go—again, the cough of the watchman.If they ask about thirst, tell them no one could carry water as faras it had to go, so that when it was time to rest,people went to the spigot at the edge of the train tracksand cupped their hands under the water, lowering their faces to drink.Tell them a man could stand at noon in the park wearing nothing but underwearand beg for hours with his cup empty.Tell them you could sit quietly while phrases you didn't know you knew rose up in the language there and on an undisturbed lake in your mind you could back float—that weightless prayer that prays Let me die with my toes pointing up at the sun.When they ask what people will eventually get around to asking, How was the food? Tell them batata, mamón, guanábana, maní,indigenous crops exchanging places with hunger,giving up to the dark store window whose inventory is one handof bananas sold one banana at a time, giving up to little pyramids of limesby the side of the road and the kids who tend them, dreamingof a few coins tossed down in the dirt. ,Barbara Ras,Money & Economics
23,                    All                ,The prisoner can’t go any longer, but he does.The beggar can’t go on begging, but watch—Tomorrow he’ll be in the alley, holding out a bowlTo everyone, to even a young, possibly poorer, child.The mother can’t go on believing,But she will kneel for hours in the cathedral,Holding silence in her arms.The rain goes on, daily, sometimes, and we cry,As often as not alone.The fishmonger, the bell ringer, the cook, eachCan be corrupted in a less than dire way.Nothing can replace the sea breezes you were born to.Nothing can stay the shy ache in the palmyou hold out to the fortune-teller.The concrete lions on her steps go onMaking bloodless journeys, they go onHunting in air longer than any of you will live to watch,Hunting still after your futures become all irisesand blamelessness. ,Barbara Ras,Life Choices,Faith & Doubt
24,                    Sleeping with Butler’s Lives of the Saints,After Octavio PazWhat’s most human must drivean arrow to the heart. Ghosts, too, must abide by this directive& remain transparent, going about their business in old houses.Before I was an I, I longed to be ethereal. Sprouting wings at will & gliding throughcul-de-sacs and malls around the valley. My hands, too, would gradually disappearfollowed by my arms, then neck & head until my whole body was slight as allergen.Before I was an I, I spoke an old language that would return on drowsy afternoons.Therefore I struggled to say the simplest sentences. So much sothat the maligned semicolon became an ardent ally, an islandof pause and the deep breath. The comma, too, bless its tiny soul,was the crumb which the god of small favors multipliedtenfold for my morning pie. Before I was an I, knowledgeclung to me like burrs & hunger guided my ship like the barefoot light                on the sleeping land & sea. ,Eugene Gloria,Language & Linguistics,Poetry & Poets
25,                    Hoodlum Birds                ,The fearless blackbirds see me againat the footpath beside the tall grassessprouting like unruly morning hair.They caw and caw like vulgar boyson street corners making love to girlswith their “hey mamathis” and their “hey mama that.”But this gang of birds is much too slick.They are my homeys of the airwith their mousse-backed hair and Crayolablack coats like small fry hoods who smokeand joke about each other’s mothers,virginal sisters, and the sweet arc of revenge.These birds spurn my uneaten celery sticks,feckless gestures, ineffective hosannas.They tag one another, shrill and terrible,caroling each to each my weekly wages.But they let me pass, then flit away.They won’t mess with me this time—they know where I live. ,Eugene Gloria,Animals
26,                    Wilde's Tomb                ,But these, thy lovers are not dead.…They will rise up and hear your voice. . .. and run to kiss your mouth.         –The SphinxIn the garden of Père Lachaise,city of the dead, we passed angelscovering their faces in shame,& nineteenth-century trees, with tops bowedas if their only purpose was to grieve,& crossed the Transversales to Wilde’s grave. When lovers leave, they leave their kissesglistening on the gray slab,on impressions of lips themselves,a tissue of strangers’ cellsthe conservators cannot leave alone,& scrub the graffiti, as the plaque decreesby law, no one can deface this tomb,& still the images of lips remain,dark gray stains of animal fatimprisoned in limestone. Lips are pressed as high as loversclimb, against the Sphinx’s ridiculousheaddress, on the carved trumpetof fame, & on the cheeks of its voracious faceof mindless passion flying with eyes pinched tight,that some farsighted lover tried to openwith lines from a red pen, like a blepharoplasty,while others kissed its sybaritic mouthto make a poem a prophecy. So here is love alivesurviving the wreckage it survives,a lipstick envelope of hearts on their flightto some other place, less aware,more receiving, a final Champ de Grâce. ,Michael Gessner,Poetry & Poets
27,                    The Poem of Death                ,This is the poem of death.There is only oneand no other. Every one is an occasion,one way or another,and the last poem is this poem of death. It is an occasion like no other.I will no longer lope after elegance,beauty’s body, or love’s wonder. I will be sorry for everythingI was, and for everything I was not.I speak to you as if you were my brother. I will forgive everyone.Death will make this possible.There will be no other. Death was in the mindbefore thought or love,in ourselves, and in our lovers. The poem of death is speechless.A companion will appear againlike another self, like your brother. Enough now, enough has been said.The spinning leaf will spinlike no other. ,Michael Gessner,Death

No more studies of kindness or courtesy,nor grace or charity, all is needless now.

The lion was sad. He suffered usTo touch him. When I placed the bread of my handsIn his mammalian heat, I was remindedThat the world outside this worldIs all vinegar and gall, that to be a young girl at the foot of a godRequires patience. Timing. The White Witch has mustered her partisans.Because I am fascinated by her bracelets strung with baby teeth,I will remember her as the womanWho grins with her wrists. From my thicket of heatherI note that in her own congenital wayShe is pure, that tonight she ushers something new into the world. I cannot stop it. I cannot stop it just as in that other placeI could not keep the planes with their spiked fires from coming.Though in this closed realm the smell of camphor is overwhelmingI have nothing but my hands to useIn ministering to the dead. Here tooMy hands must suffice. Hush now while I testify. They are shaving him.The corona of his mane falls awayLike pieces of money.

Mark the spot where the lake recededafter a winter of light snow. The stairs on which someoneslapped you. The place where the family dog hung itselfby jumping over the back fence while still on the dog run,hours later its body like a limp flag on a windless day.Draw a map, someone says. Let yourself remember.In the refugee camp a hundred thousand strongdraw the stony outcrop from which you could no longer seethe plume of smoke that was your village. Draw a squarefor the bathroom stall where Grandpa hid each dayin order to eat his one egg free from the starving eyesof his classmates, an X for the courthouse where you and hewere naturalized, a broken line for the journey.

On the second floorat Pranash University the people wait their turn. Have youdrawn your map, Jon asks. He has rolled up his sleeves.Forty-five minutes to noon the Prince stands up and saysthat the monks must be excused. We watch them file out,saffron robes as if their bodies have burst into blossom.Draw a map. Fly halfway around the globe. Here is the roomnext to the library where you realize how poor your tradition is,the local people with poetic forms still in use that date backto the time of Christ. Tell us about your map. Explainhow these wavy lines represent the river, this rectanglethe school-turned-prison where only sevenescaped with their lives. This is my map. This star the placewhere I sat in a roomful of people among whom not onewas not touched by genocide. Every last map resplendent with deaththough nobody knows where their loved ones lie buried.How many times can I appropriate a story that is not mine to tell?The woman stands up and says she is not a poet, that shedoesn’t have the words.

In the first room with the blown up black-and-white of a human body gone abstract someone hasto turn and face the wall not because of the human painrepresented in the photo but because of her calmness, the tranquility with which she tells us that her fatherand her sister and her brother were killed. In graduate schoola whole workshop devoted to an image of a woman with bleach thrown in the face and the question of whether or notthe author could write, “The full moon sat in the windowlike a calcified eye, the woman’s face aglow with a knowingness.” I felt it come over me and I couldn’t stop. I tried to pull myselftogether and I couldn’t. They were children. An army of childsoldiers. In the room papered with photos of the Khmer Rouge picture after picture of teenagers, children whose parentswere killed so that they would be left alone in the worldto do the grisly work that precedes paradise. And the photos of the victims, the woman holding her newbornin her arms as her head is positioned in a vise, in this casethe vise an instrument not of torture but of documentation, the head held still as the camera capturesthe image, the thing linking all their faces, the abject fearand total hopelessness as exists in only a handful of places in the history of the visible world.For three $US per person she will guide you through what wasTuol Sleng prison, hill of the strychnine tree. Without any affectation she will tell you the story of howher father and her sister and her brother went amongthe two million dead.

We knew better than to call themby their names, Light that Shines Throughout the Universe                         and His consort, but there were stories of  travelers lost  in the foothills of  the Hindu  Kush and a distantbrilliance that led them home. The way a candle physically enters                                        your body after it has been snuffed out. The pearly smoke suffused in the air. In one schoolhundreds  of  miles  away  all  the   girls  my age  were  poisoned,                              and last week outside the capital a woman like my  sister was shot dead  in front of a crowd by two menwho forced their bodies into her body and then judged her an infidel                                        so they could kill her and be done with it.  After the  visitors were blasted I had a dream.I saw a human man standing by a lake and no one was looking at him                                          directly. His image on the surface of the water cleaner than anything in this world.In   my   dream  the  man   said,  “Thousands   of  lifetimes  ago                                        when my body was cut into pieces by an evil king, I was not caught up in the idea of the self.”Then  in  my   dream  someone   picked  up  a rock  and  I  woke  up.                              It took almost a month, the  great  heads  drilled with holes,  then anti-aircraft  tanks rolled in.Each hundred-foot niche now empty but each cavity left shaped like us,                              like a person. Before it happened we talked about it. Grandfather said don’t they have a share in heaven?Second Aunt said it was more realistic this way.

And   maybeyou       will      name      it      Dolores,      which       means     grief, or perhaps you will call it Mara, the Hebrew name for bitternessbecause       this      is      how     we      protect     what     we    love,by   hiding   what  it   truly  means  to   us,  the little  bag  of  gold we    keep   buried   in  the  yard,   the  thing  we will do anythingto      keep      safe,      even    going     so      far    as    to     pretendit    doesn’t    exist,   that   there’s   nothing  massing in  the  dark despite  the steady  light  emanating  from  your  face, a radianceso bright sometimes I can’t look at you, the joy so  overpoweringyou     want    to     shout   it     from   the    highest    mountaintop straight into God’s ear. ,Quan Barry,Birth & Birthdays
49,                    crossing the South China Sea as analgesia                ,One day we will all be like this—the boat’s sickening pitch, & the delicateness     needless, consumable. How everything here naturally passes into night, a room     w/o walls. Could mindlessness keep us alive? Could bright colors? Tonight I am thinking of the young woman who dreams of her father     being shot in the head. Imagine needing to believe the one you love     has been destroyed. Now it is after midnight—the spindrift lunar & diaphanous. Here alone on deck     could I make peace w/it all in thirty seconds—the water’s inherent rising, the gasping     for air? I have never seen such omnipresence, such vast dreamlessness—       but I too am such things. What does it mean to be eroded? What would be the significance of slipping one leg     over the rail & straddling the indifference? Yes. Once upon a time we spent three days on a boat out of Kobé, Japan. All night the waves. All night the somnambulistic urges. Or how as children we would swim in a hard rain—the lake’s surface ragged & torn,     but underneath the roots of the water lilies like ladders     trailing down into the marvelous. ,Quan Barry,Travels & Journeys
50,                    lion                ,Shagged-gold, at rest the great haunchesas if axled, fur sleeked like a butter rug.In the Serengeti sun, the male’s harem like a solar system, each lady keptexclusive, her seasonal heat for him alone,estrous belly pressed to the ground, then the male’s riding her musculature—throughout evolution the cat’s barbed penisnicking his breached mate as he dismounts. See the deliberate walk, cool as a criminal,the multi-jointed forepaws placed consciouslyeven by the usurped king, his eye teeth blacked, his tail rotted off, tired wag of a bloody stumpas he finally falls dying, the crucified face beddedin its wheel of hair, the tawny miscegenated eyes binocular in breadth. Shark in the long grasses.Shark in the long grass. Smell everywhere, the gazellewith its small-headed splendor gracing the plains is ambushed, devoured, its horned bone racksouvenired, the murderer’s ripping muzzle crimsoned.In the despot’s sons’ palace of pure gold the three in the iron cage lazing like statues.When the American unlocks the hinged doorour shackled hearts contract. Unhooded and naked we are pushed into their presence,and for a shining moment the animals study us,these fabulous aliens. Here in a desert captivitysnatched from the baobab’s sour fruit,their swagged bellies shifted, broken, and resignedly the ancient drive rose up only in one—its head wreathed beyond sorrowas it slouched out of the habitual darkness, the permanent rictus of its terrible mouthpain-struck. The thing came toward mewith its ruined light, and I saw affliction in it. Dream of mastery. Dream of being wholly consumed,freed. I am the lion and the lion is me.Then the American pulls us out. ,Quan Barry,Animals,War & Conflict
